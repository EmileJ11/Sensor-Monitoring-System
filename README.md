# Sensor-Monitoring-System
## Description
The sensor monitoring system (coded in c) consists of client-side sensor nodes measuring the room temperature, and a central server-side sensor gateway that acquires all sensor data from the sensor nodes. It checks for connections, makes calculations and writes to a csv file multithreaded + forked writing to log file.
